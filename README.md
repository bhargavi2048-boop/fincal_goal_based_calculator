## 🔍 Overview

**Fincal** is a multi-page, goal-based investment calculator built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

It is designed for **investor education and awareness** — helping users understand how **inflation** and **return assumptions** can impact the future value of a financial goal, and estimate the **required monthly SIP** (illustrative) needed to reach it.

> ⚠️ All calculations are illustrative and for educational purposes only. See [Disclaimer](#-disclaimer).

---

## 🧮 What It Computes

Given the following user inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Current Cost of Goal** | Present value of the goal in ₹ |
| **Years to Goal** | Time horizon in years |
| **Inflation Rate** | Annual inflation assumption (%) |
| **Expected Annual Return** | Expected portfolio return per year (%) |

Fincal computes:

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| **Inflated Goal Value (FV)** | Future cost of the goal after inflation compounding |
| **Required Monthly SIP** | Illustrative monthly investment needed to reach FV |

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Product & UX
- **Editable assumptions** — inflation and return rates are fully user-controlled
- **Responsive design** — optimised for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Shareable state via URL parameters** — copy a link that preserves all input values
- **Transparent math** — dedicated Formula page explains every calculation step

### ♿ Accessibility (WCAG-Oriented)
- Semantic HTML structure: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- Skip link for keyboard-only users
- Clear form labels, hints, and inline error messages
- `aria-describedby` and `role="alert"` for screen reader support
- Visible `:focus-visible` styles for keyboard navigation
- Reduced-motion support via `prefers-reduced-motion`

### ⚙️ Engineering
- Calculation logic separated into `src/lib/finance/*` — clean, testable, and independent of UI
- Next.js App Router with modern file-based routing
- Type-safe inputs and outputs with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive styling

---

## 📐 Calculation Model

All formulas are fully transparent and documented on the [Formula page](/formula).

### Step 1 — Inflate the Goal Value (Future Value)

Compounds the present cost of the goal by inflation over the time horizon:

```
FV = Present Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years
```

### Step 2 — Required Monthly SIP (Illustrative)

Converts the annual return to a monthly rate and computes the SIP needed to accumulate FV:

```
Monthly Rate  r = Annual Return ÷ 12
Total Months  n = Years × 12

Required SIP = FV × r ÷ [((1 + r)^n − 1) × (1 + r)]
```

> **Edge case:** If the assumed annual return is **0%**, the calculator uses `FV ÷ n` as an illustrative fallback to avoid division by zero.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v20+ (v22+ recommended)
- **npm** v9+

Verify:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bhargavi2048-boop/Fincal-goal-based-calculator.git

# 2. Navigate into the project folder
cd Fincal-goal-based-calculator

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"localhost refused to connect"** (WSL / VM / remote shell)

Bind the dev server to all network interfaces:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3000 npm run dev
```

Then access via:
- `http://localhost:3000` — on the same machine
- `http://<your-ip>:3000` — from a remote machine or VM

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG-Oriented)

Fincal is built with accessibility as a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

| Practice | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Semantic HTML | `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` throughout |
| Skip link | Keyboard users can skip directly to main content |
| Form labels | Every input has an explicit `<label>` |
| Error messaging | Inline errors use `role="alert"` and `aria-describedby` |
| Focus styles | `:focus-visible` ensures visible keyboard focus rings |
| Motion safety | Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| Screen reader | Tested with structure that supports assistive technology |

Full implementation notes are available on the [Accessibility page](/accessibility).
